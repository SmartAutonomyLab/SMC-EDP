# Vissim Simulator
This folder contains the simulation input file for the traffic system model used in the conference paper.

## Required Software
The PTV Vissim and PTV Viswalk software for students can be found [here](https://your.visum.ptvgroup.com/vision-traffic-suite-students-en). Download and install the one that says "Download PTV Vissim & PTV Viswalk."

## Using the Provided Simulation Input File
All three `.inp0`, `.inpx`, and `.layx` files are needed for the simulation to work properly. To access the simulation, open the `.inpx` file.

## Tutorials
There are many tutorials available online. [Here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsp6xnws6TOAy1bjEw9eeXN5tAHQsgxh0) is one example for beginners.

## Simulation Parameters
To set different simulation parameters, go to the "Simulation" tab at the top, then click "Parameters." A window will pop-up like the following:
